## Hi there, I'm Warner ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring IT professional, currently studying for a degree in Information and Cybersecurity Operations. 
I made this repo for the purpose of documenting my learning journey.

I am currently taking Python courses, so most of the things I put here will be in python. (and they will more than likely be very bad)


I will also add good tools/resources I find.

I am also looking for Internship opportunities in IT/Cybersecurity

Here are my socials (my linkedin)
